# SIDCUP-FAMILY-GOLF-CLONE
This project is a frontend clone of the Sidcup Family Golf website, designed to replicate its layout, structure, and interactive elements.
Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it showcases responsive design and animated features that mirror the original websiteâ€™s user interface. 

This Is the Most Basic Project inorder to Absorb My skills over HTML,CSS AND JS.
